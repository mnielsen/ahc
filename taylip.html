	Neal Stephenson's science fiction novel <em>The Diamond

	&ldquo;book&rdquo;, <em>The Young Lady's Illustrated

    <h3>An Active Learning Environment to Raise the Ceiling</h3>

    <p>
      A fair number of my non-physicist friends have tried to teach
      themselves quantum mechanics. While they're extremely bright and
      self-motivated people, they usually fail.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why do they fail?
    </p>

    <p>
      If they were to read a Stephen King novel, they certainly would
      not fail. They might lose interest, but they wouldn't fail
      because it was too hard. And yet several of them have told me
      they failed at learning quantum mechanics because it was
      &ldquo;too hard&rdquo;. It's as though there's a kind of ceiling
      on the difficulty of the material they can really master while
      working on their own. While this ceiling can (and does) change
      over the course of a lifetime, it usually only changes
      relatively slowly.
    </p>

    <p>
      My own experience with using Anki to read outside my field is
      that it greatly raised the ceiling. Many fields that I would
      formerly have found extremely daunting immediately became easy,
      almost trivial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine an Active Learning Environment that integrated an essay
      form:
    </p>

    XXX

    <p>
      with questions:
    </p>

    XXX

    <p>
      What's more, you'd be actively re-tested on those questions in
      the future, prompted both online, on mobile, and perhaps through
      other channels (text, email, and so on):
    </p>

    XXX

    <p>
      I believe it would be possible to raise the ceiling on people's
      ability to understand in this way. Might it be possible, for
      instance, to teach 100,000 people quantum mechanics? Not in the
      sense of having vaguely understood a bunch of differential
      equations. But in the sense of having a detailed, durable
      understanding of the core ideas of quantum mechanics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Might it be possible to double the number of people in the world
      who have a detailed understanding of quantum mechanics? Increase
      by a factor of 10? Of 100?
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, it would not just be for quantum mechanics. It could
      be for any subject. But I believe it would be especially
      interesting for subjects often thought to be extremely
      challening &ndash; things like advanced mathematics or
      theoretical physics. For this reason, in the example which
      follow I'll often refer to quantum mechanics, but of course
      this <em>is</em> just an example.
    </p>

    <p>
      In designing a site like this it would be tempting to think of
      it as an extension of an essay. The mocked up screenshots I've
      shown above have this flavour. This is tempting because the
      essay is a known, conventional media form. Such a site would end
      up looking something like a textbook &ndash; a bit like my
      interactive textbook
      on <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com">Neural
      Networks and Deep Learning</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Treating the site as an extension of the essay form would be a
      mistake. It would be letting a known media form drive the
      arrangement of the site by default.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's better to ask instead: what media form could we create that
      would do most to promote understanding?
    </p>

    <p>
      In this case the core event &ndash; the thing driving
      understanding &ndash; would be the questions. This means making
      users' core experience be about their relationship to the
      questions:
    </p>

    XXX --- "You have mastered 77% of the questions about Quantum
    Mechanics, and are learning 9%." "You have mastered 12% of the
    questions about Quantum Field Theory, and are learning 3%."
    Today's questions. Statistics.

    <p>
      This is not to say the essay component would not be
      important. It would be the scaffolding on which the web of
      questions would be created. But ultimately it would be people's
      ability to think differently &ndash; as expressed by their
      ability to answer questions &ndash; that was transformative
      event for people.
    </p>

    <p>
      (Secondarily, the essay component would be an exceptionally good
      form of marketing, providing a funnel for people to enter the
      site. But that should truly be secondary.)
    </p>

    <p>
      In naming this media form*<span class="marginnote">* Computers
      support so many different media forms that it is arguably a
      mistake to be trying to name them all. Nonetheless, I need some
      term of reference for this idea.</span>, I was tempted to use
      the term &ldquo;active essay&rdquo;. It's a good term, one I've
      heard several people suggest for various types of interactive
      essay. However, <a href="">explorable explanation</a> seems to
      have won out for that type of work. Instead, I've adopted the
      term <em>Active Learning Environment</em>. It's a little
      cumbersome, but has the advantage of stressing the centrality of
      active learning, rather than making it sound like a variation on
      an essay. This, in turn, makes it a little easier to keep an eye
      on the central fact, which is how to design this media form to
      best promote understanding, rather than thinking of it as some
      type of essay.
    </p>

    <p>
      A key principle behind the site is that the better the
      questions, the better the resulting understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not a small point.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's tempting to think of the questions as a sort of add on,
      something that you would go through the motions of creating
      them. In fact, I believe the range in possible quality for a set
      of questions would be enormous, comparable to the way prose can
      vary from the writing of a first grader to the writing of a
      Shakespeare.
    </p>

    <p>
      How can you get Shakespeare-level questions? Or, failing that,
      at least how can you create the highest-quality questions?  What
      principles should the questions follow to ensure they were of
      high quality?
    </p>

    <p>
      Naturally, the questions would reflect many of the ideas we've
      discussed earlier. They'd mostly be atomic. They'd form a rich,
      interconnected web, with many questions appearing in multiple
      variations. They'd involve rich elaborations, to help people
      form deep memories.
    </p>

    <p>
      And so on. I won't reiterate all the ideas discussed earlier.
      But it is worth mentioning a few things that go beyond our
      earlier discussion.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Completeness of coverage:</strong> What does it mean to
      understand a subject? At some level, the question is
      ill-defined. It's always possible to deepen one's understanding,
      even of the most apparently trivial aspects of a subject. There
      is an article*<span class="marginnote">* This was pre-web, and I
      stumbled across the article in a library. I've been unable to
      find it since. A natural guess is that I've misremembered the
      author; if that's the case, the story perhaps loses some of its
      interest. Nonetheless, I believe the key point is still
      valid.</span> by the mathematician Kolmogorov discussing the
      equals sign: in what ways was it a good notation, a poor
      notation, could it be improved? The humble equals sign, which
      few of us ever give much thought to, can be understood much more
      deeply &ndash; deeply enough to deserve several pages of
      discussion by one of the greatest mathematicians ever!
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, there is some notion of achieving basic mastery of a
      subject. Can we find a set of questions where thoroughly
      mastering those questions would also mean someone had achieved
      at least a basic mastery of a subject*<span class="marginnote">*
      In Newtonian physics an attempt has been made in this direction
      with the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). The FCI has also been
      criticised, but it's a worthwhile line of work.</span>? That
      sort of completeness is worth aspiring to.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Scalability:</strong> Of course, you'd like the process
      to be scalable. The point isn't to just raise the ceiling for
      one subject!  While the process would no doubt begin with
      prototypes, once a powerful approach had been idntified, you'd
      want to scale up the production of very high quality Active
      Learning Environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      I suspect a large step toward this would be the development of a
      very good checklist to use during production. Certainly, many
      problems could be overcome with a good checklist. Indeed, this
      is even true of existing books and essays, which often have
      glaring, easily spotted issues. For instance, it's surprisingly
      common to read a textbook in which many advanced terms &ndash;
      certainly, more advanced than most readers would be familiar
      with &ndash; are used without any explanation.
    </p>

    <p>
      While many problems could be overcome using good checklist,
      there are also problems which couldn't be overcome in this
      way. To produce the very best writing requires an author with
      extraordinarily deep understanding, and often a good dose of
      many other characteristics: imagination, with, a beautiful way
      with words, and so on. Such qualities are significantly more
      difficult to systematize.
    </p>

    <p>
      With that said, I believe it's possible to systematize the
      production of materials which are far better than most textbooks
      in the quality of the prose. This would be significant in its
      own right. But even more important: the active learning features
      &ndash; distributed practice, thee testing effect, and so on
      &ndash; would qualitatively change the experience, and raise the
      ceiling for users.
    </p>

    <p>
      An Active Learning Environment could go beyond Anki in many
      ways.  Here's a few ideas:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Automatic elaboration and variation of
      questions:</strong> As we discussed earlier, much research
      suggests that there is a benefit to elaborations and variations
      on questions. This is true even of rather elementary variations
      and elaborations. The environment could certainly automatically
      generate some variations on elaborations. E.g.: the question
      &ldquo;Who painted &lsquo;The Starry Night&rsquo;?&rdquo; might
      be used to generate the question &ldquo;Which artist pained
      &lsquo;The Starry Night&rsquo;?&rdquo; This is an extremely
      minor variation, but I wouldn't be surpised if using both
      variations was better than either one alone.</li>

      <li>
	<strong>Better schedule for practice:</strong> In scheduling,
	Anki uses a very simple approach. It doesn't analyse the
	question (e.g., use of unfamiliar words, more complex
	structure, and so on). It doesn't incorporate past performance
	of other users. And it uses few facts about the user's own
	past performance. We could use machine learning models to
	build a better practice schedule*<span class="marginnote">*
	The language learning
	company <a href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> has
	reported some promising preliminary experiments in this
	direction: Burr Settles and Brendan
	Meeder, <a href="assets/Settles2016a.pdf">A Trainable Spaced
	Repetition Model for Language Learning</a> (2016).</span>.  I
	wouldn't be surprised if you could obtain a factor of two or
	so reduction in practice time in this way &ndash; a very
	substantial improvement.  (XXX - Bahrick and Bahrick. Do we
	really want to review before we forget? Can we improve the
	resetting model?)
      </li>

      <li><strong>Map of mastery:</strong> That is, provide users with
	visual representations showing where they are strong in a
	subject, where they are weak, and what they haven't yet
	covered.</li>

      <li><strong>Video:</strong> My description has assumed the base
      learning materials are a mixture of essay and questions. It'd be
      interesting to experiment with video. At least personally, I
      find I connect more emotionally to video, but I also often find
      it rare that I can pick up all the details necessary to master a
      subject. Perhaps a video plus question format would
      </li>

      <li><strong>Improved motivation:</strong> The designers of sites
      such as Twitter and Facebook have found many patterns that can
      be used to deeply involve users. These patterns are often
      exploited so users behave in ways misaligned with their own best
      interests*<span class="marginnote">*
      See <a href="http://humanetech.com/">Time Well
      Spent</a>.</span>. Might it be possible to use some of those
      patterns in more humane ways, serving users' desires to learn
      and achieve understanding?
      </li>      
	
    </ul>

    <p>
      An Active Learning Environment would be a qualitative
      improvement over conventional essays, enabling users to durably
      retain deep knowledge about subjects that were formerly
      inaccessible. It would truly raise the ceiling. This would be a
      huge advantage over most educational websites today, such as
      Khan Academy. While such sites are often valuable, they don't
      necessarily do much to raise the ceiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      An Active Learning Environment would also be a qualitative
      improvement over shared Anki decks. While shared decks can be
      useful, they lack many key attributes of an Active Learning
      Environment. They lack a strong narrative hook that can be used
      to drive initial interest. They lack a strong overall narrative
      to sustain interest, and to help users organize and integrate
      their understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are enormous advantages. But perhaps even more important
      is that shared Anki decks lack depth. It is difficult to
      construct an Anki deck that will shepherd another user along,
      helping them build up an understanding, starting from cards at
      an elementary level and gradually progressing to a deeper
      understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Part of the difficulty is that Anki provides limited control
      over the order in which cards are presented. If a deck contains
      cards at many different levels of difficulty, it's easy for a
      beginner to end up stuck on questions involving unfamiliar
      concepts.  It's a bit too much like reading the pages of a
      textbook which has been cut up into pieces, and randomly
      reshuffled!
    </p>

    <p>
      But perhaps more important: good explanation is not the forte of
      Anki cards. Good explanations are often rich and multifaceted,
      tying many ideas together. By contrast, good Anki cards are
      usually simple and atomic. Richness emerges, but it emerges out
      of the entire collection of cards.  And so Anki is not
      especially suited to be an explanatory medium. In some sense, an
      Active Learning Environment is an answer to the question: how
      could we create a good explanatory medium that also integrates
      the advantages of distributed practice?
    </p>

    <p>
      What would success mean for an Active Learning Environment?
    </p>

    <p>
      It's conventional for websites to measure success by the number
      of users. But in this case there would be a much more compelling
      number to track: the number of people who achieved mastery over
      a subject.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose, for example, that 1,000 people achieved mastery over
      the quantum mechanics materials. That's perhaps comparable to
      the impact of a physics professor teaching quantum mechanics for
      30 years. Indeed, given that most people who take university
      quantum mechanics' classes don't durably recall much, it would
      perhaps be beyond what the physics professor
      achieves*<span class="marginnote">* While the understanding
      might be longer lasting than a traditional class, there may be
      types of understanding achieved in a traditional class
      that </span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Going further, suppose 10,000 people achieved mastery. That
      would certainly be beyond what any professor achieves, and would
      also be well beyond typical MOOC certification rates. 100,000
      people achieving mastery would perhaps double (or more) the
      number of people in the world who understand quantum
      mechanics. Beyond that, if 1,000,000 people mastered it, that
      would make a dramatic qualitative shift in the human race's
      understanding of quantum mechanics.
    </p>

    <p>
      These perhaps seem unrealistic as goals. My own belief is that
      with very high quality material, users would be extremely
      excited, understanding that they were gradually coming to
      achieve mastery of a subject they had formerly believed was
      inaccessible. And so, over a period of years, multiple thousands
      of people achieving mastery should well be possible.
    </p>

    <h3>What other processes of understanding could an Active
      Learning Environment support?</h3>

    <p>
      I've argued that memory is far more crucial to understanding
      than is commonly thought. But it is not the same as
      understanding. Indeed, as I said above, understanding is
      essentially an open-ended process. For any given subject it's
      always possible to go deeper.
    </p>

    <p>
      What other types of understanding are involved in truly
      mastering a subject? And might it be possible to build those
      into an Active Learning Environment?
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Execution of simple procedures:</strong> One important
      type of understanding is execution of simple procedure. For
      instance, executing the algorithm to multiply two numbers on a
      piece of paper:
    </p>

    <pre>
      581
   &times;  162
   ------
   ??????
    </pre>

    <p>
      At a higher level, it may mean carrying out some more complex
      procedure,
      say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_variables">separation
      of variables</a>, to solve a differential equation arising in
      some quantum mechanics problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, carrying out such procedures &ndash; of either type &ndash;
      certainly involves some kinds of long-term memory. You need to
      remember the steps in the procedure to multiply, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, there is a difference between remembering the steps in a
      procedure and actually carrying out the procedure. The former is
      a declarative memory, of the sort that Anki is extremely useful
      for forming.  The latter is a procedural memory, which our
      brains store using a separate memory system XXX. As a result,
      you can have a perfect memory of the steps to take in carrying
      out a procedure, and yet be rather slow and uncertain when you
      carry it out. The converse can be true, too: for instance, your
      fingers may know how to enter a password on your computer, and
      yet you may have a hard time bringing the password to mind.
