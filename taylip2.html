	<em>This is version 2 of my thinking for this project. I
	suspect that by version 3 it'll be in good shape.</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Reminiscing on his friend Richard Feynman, the computer
	scientists Danny Hillis observed:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and
	place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time
	when things worked as they were supposed to and great things
	were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos
	during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got
	&ldquo;cockeyed&rdquo;, Richard would look back and try to
	understand how now was different than then.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	Most of us have had some form of this experience, though
	perhaps not as starkly as Feynman. Environments that
	challenged and helped enlarge us. We join a theatre group or a
	sports team or a collaboration or start an organization. It
	may, perhaps, grow to take over our life, perhaps even pulling
	us into 60-, 80-, 100-hour weeks of exhilaration and terror
	and exhaustion and joy.
      </p>

      <p>
	The author Lois Bujold has observed that these experiences are
	not merely passing things. They are transformative of who we
	are:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	All great human deeds both consume and transform their
	doers. Consider an athlete, or a scientist, or an independent
	business creator. In service of their goals they lay down time
	and energy and many other choices and pleasures; in return,
	they become most truly themselves. A false destiny may be
	spotted by the fact that it consumes without transforming,
	without giving back the enlarged self&hellip; [T]hese basic
	human transformational deeds &hellip; change our fundamental
	relationship with the universe &hellip; [they] consume the old
	self, and replace it with something new, often better and
	wiser, sometimes wearier or disillusioned, or tense and
	terrified, certainly more self-knowing, but never the same
	again.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	In his 1995 science fiction novel &ldquo;The Diamond
	Age&rdquo; the author Neal Stephenson has describe a
	particularly striking example of such an environment. The
	novel tells the story of a poor young girl named Nell who
	accidentally comes into possession of a marvellous digital
	&ldquo;book&rdquo;, <em>The Young Lady's Illustrated
	Primer</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
	The Primer is not a book as we currently conceive of books. It
	is a fully interactive learning environment. It can answer
	Nell's questions. It teaches her to read, and many other
	skills. It protects her and provides emotional support.
      </p>

      <p>
	The Primer is a striking idea. It grew out of visions from
	researchers such as Alan Kay (the Dynabook), Seymour Papert
	(Logo), and Donald Blitzer (Plato). But, of course,
	Stephenson's vision <em>is</em> fiction. It doesn't describe
	in detail how the Primer works, any more than a science
	fiction writer describing faster-than-light travel will
	describe the necessary physics. 
      </p>

      <p>
	This is not one of my standard essays. Rather, it's an
	exploration, an attempt to understand what would be required
	to build a particular type of environment. It's not quite the
	Primer I'm trying to describe here. But it would achieve many
	of the same ends. I don't see all the details, but there are
	some extremely powerful ideas here, ideas which are not being
	pursued seriously in any system.
      </p>

      <p>
	I believe we can build environments that will be
	transformative for much of the world's population. They will
	change how people understand; how they think; how they act;
	and how they create. These notes are an attempt to describe
	how that will happen.
      </p>

      <p>
	This isn't intended to be shared with other people, for the
	most part. This is me <em>thinking</em> aloud, excitedly. It's
	me trying to figure out what do I really think. There may be a
	made-for-audiences version in the future. But right now I want
	to unabashedly explore ideas as boldly as possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Narrative embedding of spaced repetition</h2>

      <p>
	Spaced-repetiton study is a remarkably effective tool for
	improving people's basic memory. But although the payoff is
	enormous, there are barriers which have (so for) prevented it
	from taking off. Worse, those barriers are only partially
	understood, and only by a small number of people. It's
	unsurprising it hasn't been more widely used.
      </p>

      <p>
	I believe spaced-repetition study can be used to greatly
	reduce the effort in mastering technical material. In
	particular, it's a tremendous amplifier for internalizing the
	large number of new notations and nomenclature. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
	There are three main issues I see with existing
	spaced-repetition systems, like DuoLingo and Anki:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li><strong>The systems are shallow:</strong> I mean this in
	two senses. First, the huge majority of uses are for rather
	shallow material &ndash; things like the countries-of-Africa.
	Second, many uses don't cumulatively build from simple to
	  complex material.</li>

	<li><strong>They are not emotionally engaging, with little
	    narrative arc:</strong> An Anki deck may be very
	    informative, but it is left almost completely up to the
	    user to supply the emotional relationship. Ditto DuoLingo.
	    Both are just very disconnected from any emotional story
	    or narrative embedding.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Most people don't know how to design good
	questions:</strong> This includes the designers of DuoLingo,
	and most users of Anki. Designing good questions is, in my
	opinion, a potentially virtuoso talent &ndash; one I haven't
	yet mastered, though I'm working on it. And having
	well-designed questions is an enormous amplifier on the
	utility.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	This all points toward embedding spaced-repetition questions
	inside some sort of overall narrative. That narrative can
	build up to a deeper and deeper understanding. And it can
	foster an emotional connection to the material.
      </p>

      <p>
	It also points toward gradually developing an informal theory
	of question design. What are good questiosn? What principles
	should govern their design? This will require a lot of
	experimentation and continual reflection. Nonetheless I
	believe this idea of <em>virtuoso question-asking</em> is a
	skill well worth fostering.
      </p>

      <p>
	How would these ideas work in practice? There's hundreds of
	important design decisions that would need to be made. It'd
	take a lot of work to figure those out. Still, I believe these
	two ideas are important: a narrative embedding for spaced
	repetition; and a virtuoso set of principles for designing
	great questions.
      </p>

      <h2>Both emotional and cognitive mastery</h2>

      <p>
	One of the most extraordinary YouTube channels is
	3Blue1Brown. The proprietor, Grant Sanderson, has built a
	channel with more than a million subscribers, explaining the
	details of postgraduate level mathematics. 
      </p>

      <P>
	3Blue1Brown is often described as an &ldquo;educational&rdquo;
	YouTube channel. But in conversations, Grant has repeatedly
	stressed that he does not view his channel as primarily
	educational. Rather, he views it as entertainment. It's
	intended to provide an enjoyable and stimulating experience of
	mathematics, a sense that mathematics contains beauty and awe.
      </P>

      <p>
	It is not, however, intended that watchers will walk away
	remembering the details of what they have seen &ndash; how a
	proof works, the details of definitions, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
	That material is in the videos, and Grant tells me a few
	dedicated viewers do repeatedly watch the videos, and fill in
	a detailed understanding. But he believes most people are
	content with the primarily emotional experience.
      </p>

      <p>
	By conventional educational lights, such an experience is a
	failure. But I don't think it is. The most important thing in
	almost any experience is our emotional response. And, in
	particular, how it changes our emotional response to the
	world. For many people it a profound, unexpected experience to
	really understand that mathematics is extraordinarily
	beautiful, full of awe. Most people are cut off from this,
	unable to see it any more than a blind person can directly see
	a rainbow. But 3Blue1Brown removes the blinders, and reveals
	the rainbow.
      </p>

      <p>
	It has become a cliche, but Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's remark
	is true:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect
	wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach
	them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	An ideal medium will be entertaining. It will be emotionally
	engaging, perhaps even transformative.  These are not
	optional. They are essential.
      </p>

      <p>
	With that said, can we do even better?
      </p>

      <p>
	Can we build a system that creates a powerful emotional
	arc, <em>and</em> helps people master the details, enabling
	them to build a detailed, powerful model?
      </p>

      <p>
	I believe this is the correct aspiration to have.
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong>Good sources for developing a strong emotional
	arc:</strong> Vi Hart, VSauce, Grant Sanderson. And other
	YouTubers and good writers (etc), both within science and
	without. The classics are also a good source: great novelsts,
	great movie-makers, and so on. All understand a tremendous
	amount about how to provide a powerful emotional experience.
      </p>

      <p>
	It's notable, by the way, that those people &ndash; Vi Hart,
	VSauce, Grant Sanderson &ndash; have radically expanded the
	boundaries of what is possible.  Each has invented a new media
	form, which has expanded what people think is
	possible. Imagine in 2005 proposing creating a video
	explaining
      </p>
	
      <p>
	<strong>Emotional tricks:</strong> Many YouTubers use clever
	tricks to create emotional engagement. They're essentially
	forms of emotional hacking. Vi Hart and VSauce both do it
	extensively. Simple examples are things with tone and pitch
	and wordplay and humour and surprising shots. And, of course,
	there are much more sophisticated techniques as well.
      </p>

      <p>
	These techniques are fine. But when possible it's better to
	find the engagement within the material. Grant Sanderson,
	Richard Feynman, and Scott Aaronson all share in common that
	much of the emotion is <em>internal to the material</em>. That
	is, they show you the beauty and awe that is instrinsic to the
	material. You understand extraordinary problems, a little
	touch of the numinous.
      </p>

      <p>
	When possible, this internal experience is preferable.
      </p>

      <p>
	A related aesthetic that I dislike is a certain
	nerdiness-for-nerdiness's sake. It's perhaps uncharitable, but
	I wonder how much is about generating a sense of belonging for
	lonely people: a sense that this type of nerdiness defines
	their tribe. In any case, it's not something I have much
	sympathy for.
      </p>

      <h2>Essential problems</h2>

      <p>
	An extremely good way to write something that is emotionally
	gripping is to write about something that is important to
	you. That is, bring people inside the problem you want to
	solve. And, ideally, not just a problem you sort of want to
	solve. No, a burning problem, a problem that matters so, so
	much to you.
      </p>

      <p>
	Roger Penrose's book &ldquo;The Emperor's New Mind&rdquo; is a
	good example. Penrose wanted to know if computers could
	think. And he wrote a book-length discussion of the topic,
	essentially a cleaned up version of himself thinking aloud. I
	disagree completely with that book, but it's fantastic.
      </p>

      <p>
	Educators fool themselves about this all the time. Even when
	they think they're going after an essential problem, they're
	usually not. How much would they pay to know the answer? A
	million dollars?  I'll bet that if Penrose had thought a
	million dollars would answer his question, he would have
	raised it. But education is nearly always about fake work.
      </p>

      <p>
	This is pernicious. It's a very easy mindset to get into,
	perhaps because it's so common. But it's disastrous, in my
	opinion. Write to answer a question you genuinely, really
	have. You will be emotionally engaged
      </p>
	
      <p>
	(The essential problem of serious educators is how to educate
	the child. I've never once seen people brought seriously into
	that problem. They always condescend. I don't think I've ever
	been in a classroom where that was not true, at least a
	little.)
      </p>

      <p>
	More examples: Steven Pinker's books vary. He has some
	tendency toward condescension, though it's much better than
	most classrooms. Feynman's books are usually good (though not
	as good as Penrose). He clearly desperately wants to
	understand physics, and that is obvious on nearly every
	page. David Deutsch's books are good. He isn't writing those
	books to be expository. He's writing them to solve profound
	problems.
      </p>

      <p>
	Pick a profound problem. A problem you personally care
	desperately about. And write about that. If you don't have any
	problems you care that much about, your writing simply won't
	be as good. You won't care so much, and it will come across.
      </p>

      <p>
	There's an odd kind of emotional vulnerability and openness
	and honesty required here. It's not conventional. It may make
	some people uncomfortable. But for most others this is
	precisely what will make them emotionally engaged.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	(More than anything, I think this is what makes Feynman's
	writing work. He clearly cared desparately about physics and
	understanding it. By conventional pedagogical lights much of
	his writing isn't very good. But in certain respects it is
	much, much better than almost anything else ever written.)
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong>Choices for a pilot:</strong> In my early thinking
	about I mostly just conceived of it as an explanatory
	thing. Basically, developing a new medium to solve an unsolved
	expository problem. But I think it's better to actually bring
	people inside some problems I care a great deal about.
      </p>

      <p>
	Tonnes of problems come to mind: what does the wave function
	mean? What's the measurement problem, and how can we solve it?
	Why is quantum mechanics hard to combine with general
	relativity? What would quantum gravity look like? Why is
	quantum mechanics so damned hard to understand? What does it
	mean to compute anyway? Why can't we evaluate quantum
	complexity? Are there post-quantum models of computation?
      </p>

      <p>
	All of these are great, deep problems, problems which many
	people will intrinsically respond to. The issue, though, is
	that they're not problems I'm willing to go to the floor over.
      </p>

      <p>
	There are two 
      

      All of these would be good to mention in passing.  But there are
      two which come to mind as being things which I intrinsically
      care a lot more about.

      Those are the overall problem --- how to invent a media
      environment .  It's unconventional to bring people inside that
      problem. But, frankly, done honestly and intelligently, I think
      that'd be very compelling. Not to all people. But certainly to .
      And it will certainly require a certain a.
      
      Note that much of .  Belief is a curious thing in this
      context. For Anki to work well, you need to believe a set of
      thigns about it.
      
      
      What essential problems?
      
	Integrate the material .  What essential problems can I do? There's
really two levels to this. One is the problems that I mention. The
other is the problems that . What about over the longer run? For a
pilot: go MVP.  Building problem-solving skill. Add a note on mastery
learning.  Add a note on wanting to find major competitive
advantage. Inventing a new medium. In fact, inventing a series of new
media.  Media versus environment. This means that in some sense it.
You want to separate out the pursuit of big, major new ideas from the
pursuit of the small.

      Ultimately, you build communities around essential problems. And by providing people with ways to contribute.  There's a process of community induction. People must believe that they, personally.

      Ultimately, I don't think this kind of thing can enti

      <h2>Goals for a pilot</h2>

	implementing every idea. But it does mean making a substantial
	increment over existing forms.</li>

	<li>The goal is to change what we think human potential is.</li>
	
	<li>A narrative embedding of spaced repetition.  This gives
	the memory benefits of spaced repetition, while simultaneously
	enabling a powerful narrative and emotional arc, which most
	spaced-repetition systems do not. Note that it will be
	extremely challenging to design a system which makes this
	work.</li>

	<li>Develop a set of principles to govern good questions to
	ask in a narrative embedding of spaced repetition.</li>

	<li>How to make this an emotional experience that is both
	compelling and entertaining?  There are many aspects to

	<li>Bring people inside some of the greatest problems in the
	world: the problem of quantum measurement; of the meaning of

	still don't understand. This is a live project.</li>

	What are the most important problems in the world? The goal
	isn't just to explain the conventional point of view.  It's to
	get so far inside them that I have something new to say. So
	the point of these is to be a hybrid.
      </p>

      In each case, I want to get deeply iinside the problem and find
      some way of making it my own. I want to find some way of


      A vision: I distrust stuff done from the top down, starting with
      a grand vision. I want to feel that I have a set of powerful
      techniques. And my sense is that I have enough of that
      now. There is a set of principles here. Spaced repetition to
      help people internalize the basic chunks they need. Making
      memory a choice. This is greatly underestimated. Structured
      feedback loops to provide a context in which people can learn to
      problem solve. Always connect to problems which truly matter ---
      they must first matter to me if they're going to matter to
      others. (This is the rule of emotional connection, and it is
      violated by almost every educational resource.) This means I've
      gotta have something to say which I think really matters, a
      contribution to some truly significant problem. (The standard
      retort is that sometimes you need to learn uninteresting
      things. But I honestly don't think that's true. Someone can make
      everything interesting. Think of Pinker on irregular verbs. Or
      the fictional Feynman on the municipal drainage system.) Use
      video to foster emotional connection. Catalyze and support
      communities which will work on the most important problems.

      It's about helping bring people into truly important
      problems, and creating a way for them to contribute in important
      ways. It's about volitional philanthropy. It's about enablement
      on a grand scale, doing truly importnat things.


      creation of communities which are working on this. We are
      creating a new medium. In fact, it's more than that. We're going
      to use it to create entire communities, an e which are actively
      working on the . Work on problems which deserve a community,
      which deserve new institutions, which deserve the best efforts
      of our civilization.  Not in conformity to some point of
      view. Use this to stimulate experiments in the creation of .
      The biggest problems in the world: climate. Geoengineering. The
      design of governance. How to unify quantum mechanics and
      gravity. How to design new forms of life? A secular
      Bible. Foster the creation of communities doing wild experiments
      in augmenting human cognition. It's not the YOung Lady's
      Illustrated Primer. It's something much, much better. It's not
      Khan Academy. It's about something much, much better.  It's
      about volitional philanthropy.

      This is a vision I can get behind.  DO I believe I can do it? I
      want to go deeper and deeper into this. I want to flesh this
      out. And, to some extent, I want to let this vision possess
      me. This isn't all of me. But it unifies so much of what I
      believe. It's about believing so much that I will do what is
      hard for me. I will ask for help.  It's about figuring out how
      to explain what I"m doing to other people. It's about learning
      what I need to be able to do it. It's about helping other people
      get into it. It's about absorbing the setbakcs, about going
      through hard problems, or finding ways around them.

      There will often be times where I lose sight of this.

      This begins to be something I am willing to 

      I am helping people 

      I hate the structured Silicon Valley pitch. And it feels like
      that's what this is.  I believe it's possible to create a new
      type of environment, a type of environment that will enable
      people to
       
      + How did the Universe begin? What is it made of? How will it end?
